Analyzation of determining factors that influence level of life satisfaction
According to a five-year study from Edith Cowan University in Australia, families with more children have a higher level of life satisfaction rather than 
feeling overwhelmed by the big family size. The study interviewed hundreds of parents from families of different structures. They found that larger families
benefit from increased support and therefore have the highest overall life satisfaction. Our aim in this report is to investigate whether we can observe similar 
associations between life satisfaction and household size. To test the hypothesis that there is a positive correlation between household size and life satisfaction. 
we make a choice of using a linear regression model to analyze their quantitative relationship as they are both continuous variables. The dependent variable is 
life satisfaction and the independent variable is household size. The analysis does not show a statistically significant result on the correlation between life 
satisfaction and household size, but it does show that household size larger than one has a higher level of life satisfaction than a single person. We conclude that
household size larger than one has a higher level of life satisfaction.
